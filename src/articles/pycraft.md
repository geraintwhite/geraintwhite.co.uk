## [Pycraft](https://github.com/itsapi/pycraft)<span class="lang">Python</span>

To improve my Python skills I developed a game for the terminal with [Olls](https://oliverfaircliff.com). Pycraft is a text based game inspired by [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net). It is quite advanced so far, with the following features:

*   Random terrain generation with ores, hills and trees
*   Auto-saving world and multiple save support
*   Chunk saving to improve performance
*   Breaking and placing blocks
*   Inventory management
*   Custom world options
*   Crafting system
*   WIP multiplayer support

We plan on taking the project further, improving multiplayer support and implementing other block types. Download the latest version [here](https://github.com/itsapi/pycraft) and try it out. It runs best on UNIX with Python 3 but will also work on Windows CMD.
