## [Pebble Info](https://github.com/grit96/pebble_info)<span class="lang">JavaScript</span>

Recently I obtained a Pebble Smartwatch. I was keen to get into app development for it and, with my JavaScript background, the best place to start was [PebbleJS](http://developer.getpebble.com/docs/pebblejs/).

For my first app I decided to create a monitoring dashboard to keep track of my servers. It currently has the following features:

*   System Info page for my [Raspberry Pi web server](http://pi.dvbris.com)
*   My GitHub activity feed
*   Latest build information for [GitHub Listener](https://github.com/itsapi/github-listener) on my Raspberry Pi and VPS

While developing this app I used the [CloudPebble IDE](https://cloudpebble.net/ide/) which has amazing integration with the Pebble Android App allowing me to run my app on my watch from the web browser with access to the logs. It also has a Pebble emulator if you don't have access to a watch.

I intend to add additional features in the future when I have a need to monitor other information about my servers.
