## Welcome

I am part of [Dvbris.com](https://dvbris.com) building web apps with React and Node.js, and mobile apps with React Native. I also build command line applications and games in Node.js, Python and C (as well as dabbling in Haskell and other esoteric languages). I am currently a mobile software engineer at Mettle and NatWest Boxed (previously at British Telecom).
