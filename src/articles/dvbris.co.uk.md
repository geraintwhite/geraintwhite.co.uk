With the same name as our web development site, this may be confusing. This site is about my family's narrowboat Dvbris. It contains a history of work done on the boat and holidays enjoyed.

The reason for the same name is that [Olls](http://oliverfaircliff.com) and I did a lot of our early programming and development on the boat and it was a big part of our lives.

The site features a fully responsive navigation menu with fluid animations and touch friendliness which can be found on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/grit96/pen/twpLF). It also features the new responsive CSS technology flexbox which allows the layout to dynamically change depending on the screen size.
